      <font size="4" color="#008000">Welcome to the electronic version of the 
      Purnachandra Oriya Bhashakosha compiled by Gopal Chandra Praharaj during 
      the 1930’s. This CD contains the entire 7-volume work along with a word 
      index linked to appropriate pages.<br>
      <br>
      The E-Bhashakosha consists of a set of pdf (portable document format) 
      files which can be viewed on any computer independent of the operating 
      system and without the need to install any fonts. To view the pdf files 
      you must have a pdf reader installed on your computer. These readers are 
      all available free of cost. One of the most widely used pdf readers is the 
      Adobe Acrobat Reader, version 6 of which is included in this CD. This will 
      work both on Windows 98 and XP. Linux readers are generally included with 
      the distributions. That for Mac can be downloaded from the Adobe site.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4" color="#FF00FF">The E-Bhashakosha can be run from 
      the CD directly or can be installed on the hard disk. The later is 
      preferable if regular use is expected - it will require about 700 MB disk 
      space.</font><font size="4" color="#00FFFF"><br>
      </font><font size="4" color="#008000"><br>
      </font><font size="4">1.</font><font size="4" color="#00FFFF"> </font>
      <font size="4" color="#008000">If your computer does not have it already, 
      please install the Acrobat Reader 6.0 by double clicking the exe file on 
      the CD. Any other reader will also work.</font><font size="4" color="#00FF00"><br>
      </font><font size="4" color="#008000"><br>
      </font><font size="4" color="#FF00FF">A. Running from the CD:</font><font size="4" color="#008000"><br>
      </font><font size="4">2a.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> Navigate 
      to the CD drive in the Windows Explorer or My Computer and display the 
      contents. Double click on the Mukhashala.pdf (Index file) to open it in 
      the Acrobat Reader. It can also be opened from within the Acrobat Reader 
      by clicking on the FILE menu and choosing OPEN and then by choosing the 
      file on the CD. To continue running from the CD please proceed to step 3 
      below.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4" color="#FF00FF">B. Installing on the Hard Disk:</font><font size="4" color="#008000"><br>
      </font><font size="4">2b.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> Copy the 
      entire E-Bhashakosha folder onto a suitable location on your hard drive. 
      Make sure beforehand that it has sufficient disc space (about 700 MB) 
      free. It is important that the Mukhashala file and the Garbhagruha folder 
      always remain under the same parent folder and are not renamed. It is 
      helpful to create a shortcut to the Mukhashala.pdf file in the start menu 
      and/or desktop by right clicking on the file and dragging onto the desired 
      locations. The shortcut can be associated with the icon provided on the CD 
      (/Icon/E-Bhashakosha.ico)<br>
      <br>
      The E-Bhashakosha can now be launched with the shortcut or by navigating 
      to E-Bhashakosha folder on the hard disk and double clicking on the 
      Mukhashala.pdf file<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4" color="#FF00FF">The following steps are common to 
      running either from the CD or from the hard disk</font><font size="4" color="#008000"><br>
      </font><font size="4">3.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> The cover 
      page of the Mukhashala will appear in the Acrobat Reader window which will 
      give you the links to all other sections. You can jump to the desired 
      section by clicking on the appropriate link. A link can be identified by 
      moving the cursor (hand tool) over it - the palm shaped pointer will 
      change to a hand with a pointing finger when a link is encounterd.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4">4.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> On the 
      first use please look through all the pages by clicking on the NEXT button 
      on the page bottom or on the navigation panel of the Acrobat Reader. The 
      preface will give you a little background on the present work and our 
      future hopes.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4">5.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> The Acrobat 
      Reader on your computer may need to be configured to facilitate the use of 
      this E-Bhashakosha. The next section (How to use) describes this.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4">6.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> The next 
      section is an index of alphabets which are linked to the index words in 
      the Bhashakosh. Clicking on any letter will take you to the page which 
      lists the words starting with that letter.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4">7.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> The index 
      words are the pairs of words appearing on the top of every page of any 
      dictionary and give the first and the last words on the page. Such 
      word-pairs for every page of the Bhashakosha are listed here. Clicking on 
      the appropriate pair will open a new pdf file (Garbhagruha files and 
      stored under the Garbhagruha folder on the CD). <br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4">8.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> If the 
      Acrobat Reader is configured as suggested, the new file will open in a 
      separate window without closing the Mukhashala (Index) file. The two open 
      files, Mukhashala and one of the Garbhagruha files, can be viewed side by 
      side by choosing from the Acrobat menu bar Window&gt;Tile&gt;Vertically (or by 
      typing Control+Shift+L all together). <br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4">9.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> The 
      magnification of each of the file windows can be varied by clicking on the 
      file and choosing the appropriate magnification from the view menu or from 
      the tool bar. Many other facilities are available in the Reader - please 
      acquaint yourself with these from the help.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4">10.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> You can 
      now move back to the index file and choose any other words and open the 
      linked file. Several files can be kept open at the same time, but it will 
      slow your system down and may also create confusion. Hence it is better to 
      have only one Garbhagruha file at a time along with the Mukhashala file.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4" color="#FF00FF">Please Note</font><font size="4" color="#008000"><br>
      </font><font size="4">11.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> The 
      Bhashakosha pages are prepared from scanned images and because of the old 
      printing and paper staining and other damage it may be difficult to read 
      at places. The Acrobat Reader provides facility for enlarging the page 
      views upto 800%. You can get around most difficulties by experimenting 
      with this and with the other helpful features of the Reader.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="4">12.</font><font size="4" color="#008000"> The pages 
      can be printed out as images, but copying as text is not possible. The 
      sections containing English text can be converted into editable text 
      through any Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application. 
      Unfortunately, this technology for Oriya script is still a very distant 
      dream. <br>
